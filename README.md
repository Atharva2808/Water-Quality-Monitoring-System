Introduction
The Water Quality Monitoring System is a project designed to monitor and analyze the quality of water in real-time. This system aims to provide valuable insights into water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen levels. By utilizing sensors and IoT technology, the system can help in detecting pollution and ensuring safe water for consumption and environmental sustainability.

Features
Real-time monitoring of water quality parameters
Data visualization through graphs and charts
Alerts and notifications for abnormal readings
Historical data storage and analysis
User-friendly web interface for data access
Integration with IoT devices for remote monitoring
Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino/Raspberry Pi, various sensors (pH, turbidity, temperature, etc.)
Software:
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask/Django (for backend), React/Vue.js (for frontend)
